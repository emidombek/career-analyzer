     - Access and Permissions:
        Share the Google Sheets document with the email address associated with your service account. This step ensures the application has the necessary permissions to read and write data.

        With these steps completed, the Career Analyzer application will be able to interact with Google Sheets as a database for storing and retrieving survey data. Don't forget to update the `get_google_sheet_client` with your credentials and settings in the `survey.py` file. 

  6. Run the Application:
     Start the application by running:
      
      `python run.py`

  7. Deployment to Hosting Platform (Optional):
      If you plan to deploy to a hosting platform like Heroku, refer to the platform's documentation for detailed deployment steps.
