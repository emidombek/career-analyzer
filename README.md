    ```

  5. Database Setup:
     To store and manage survey data, the Career Analyzer application utilizes Google Sheets as a simple and accessible database. Follow these steps to set up the Google Sheets integration:

     - Google Sheets Credentials:
        Obtain the necessary credentials to access your Google Sheets. This typically involves creating a service account and obtaining a JSON key file.

     - Configure Environment Variables:
        In the project directory, create a .env file to store your Google Sheets credentials and other configuration data. Ensure you include the required variables to authenticate with the Google Sheets API.

     - Access and Permissions:
        Share the Google Sheets document with the email address associated with your service account. This step ensures the application has the necessary permissions to read and write data.

        With these steps completed, the Career Analyzer application will be able to interact with Google Sheets as a database for storing and retrieving survey data. Don't forget to update the `get_google_sheet_client` function with your credentials and settings in the `survey.py` file.

  6. Run the Application:
     Start the application by running:

      ```sh
